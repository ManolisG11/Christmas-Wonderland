<p>I'm dreaming of a white Christmas<br>
    Just like the ones I used to know<br>
    Where the treetops glisten and children listen<br>
    To hear sleigh bells in the snow</p>
    
    <p>I'm dreaming of a white Christmas<br>
    With every Christmas card I write<br>
    &quot;May your days be merry and bright<br>
    And may all your Christmases be white&quot;</p>
