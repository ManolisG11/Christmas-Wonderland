<p>Have a holly, jolly Christmas;<br>
    It's the best time of the year<br>
    I don't know if there'll be snow<br>
    but have a cup of cheer</p>
    
    <p>Have a holly, jolly Christmas;<br>
    And when you walk down the street<br>
    Say Hello to friends you know<br>
    and everyone you meet</p>
    
    <p>Oh ho<br>
    the mistletoe<br>
    hung where you can see;<br>
    Somebody waits for you;<br>
    Kiss her once for me</p>
    
    <p>Have a holly jolly Christmas<br>
    and in case you didn't hear<br>
    Oh by golly<br>
    have a holly jolly Christmas<br>
    this year</p>
