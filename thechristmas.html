<p>Chestnuts roasting on an open fire<br>
    Jack Frost nipping at your nose<br>
    Yuletide carols being sung by a choir<br>
    And folks dressed up like Eskimos</p>
    
    <p>Everybody knows a turkey and some mistletoe<br>
    Help to make the season bright<br>
    Tiny tots with their eyes all aglow<br>
    Will find it hard to sleep tonight<br>
    They know that Santa's on his way<br>
    He's loaded lots of toys and goodies on his sleigh<br>
    And every mother's child is gonna spy<br>
    To see if reindeers really know how to fly</p>
    
    <p>And so I'm offering this simple phrase<br>
    To kids from one to ninety-two<br>
    Although it's been said many times, many ways<br>
    Merry Christmas to you</p>
