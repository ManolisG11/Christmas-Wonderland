<p>Oh, the weather outside is frightful<br>
    But the fire is so delightful<br>
    And since we've no place to go<br>
    Let it snow! Let it snow! Let it snow!</p>
    
    <p>Man it doesn't show signs of stopping<br>
    And I brought me some corn for popping<br>
    The lights are turned way down low<br>
    Let it snow! Let it snow!</p>
    
    <p>When we finally kiss goodnight<br>
    How I'll hate going out in the storm<br>
    But if you'll really hold me tight<br>
    All the way home I'll be warm</p>
    
    <p>And the fire is slowly dying<br>
    And, my dear, we're still goodbying<br>
    But as long as you'd love me so<br>
    Let it snow! Let it snow and snow!</p>
    
    <p>When we finally kiss goodnight<br>
    How I'll hate going out in the storm<br>
    But if you really grab me tight<br>
    All the way home I'll be warm</p>
    
    <p>Oh, the fire is slowly dying<br>
    And, my dear, we're still goodbying<br>
    But as long as you'd love me so<br>
    Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow!</p>
