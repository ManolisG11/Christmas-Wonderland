<p>Rockin' around the Christmas tree<br>
    At the Christmas party hop<br>
    Mistletoe hung where you can see<br>
    Every couple tries to stop<br>
    Rockin' around the Christmas tree<br>
    Let the Christmas spirit ring<br>
    Later we'll have some pumpkin pie<br>
    And we'll do some caroling</p>
    
    <p>You will get a sentimental feeling when you hear<br>
    Voices singing, let's be jolly<br>
    Deck the halls with boughs of holly<br>
    Rockin' around the Christmas tree<br>
    Have a happy holiday<br>
    Everyone dancin' merrily<br>
    In the new old-fashioned way</p>
